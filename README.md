# The Potato Words Repository [^1]
**Auderox's bad term database, all in plain text files for ease-of-use.**

~ 🥔 ~

I originally created this list for my own personal use. It was for my Discord bot automod and Youtube blocked words list. 
I figured some people would find this helpful for their own word blacklists — particularly those in content creation and community management. 

Contributions are welcome; feel free to pull requests and talk in discussion. <br/>
I don't really use Github, nor do I understand how it fully works, so... please be patient with me. ;~;

## Instructions

1. Check if your AutoMod separates terms by comma or a new line. 
2. Choose the list of terms you want to add to your AutoMod — words, links, or symbols. 
3. Copy and paste the terms into your AutoMod.
4. Tweak as necessary. 

<ins>**Domain List Notice:**</ins> </br>
As of right now, the **domain lists** are formatted ***specifically*** for Discord AutoMod. </br>
However, it *should* work for some bots that can filter specific terms using asterisks. 

## Terms of Use

1. Do _not_ use this repository as a way to learn hate speech; or use it in projects to promote hateful ideology.
2. Please respect my time. I maintain this repository as a hobby, not as a job.
3. Please credit me if you use this repository in your projects.
4. Contributors are required to be **18+** for safety and legal reasons.
